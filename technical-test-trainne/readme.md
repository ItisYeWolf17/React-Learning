# Technical Test for Trainee People on React

For this test, you will have two APIs:

    - Facts Random: https://catfact.ninja/fact
    - Random Image: https://cataas.com/cat/says/hello

What do you need to do?

You will need to fetch a random fact about cats and display an image of a cat with the first word of the fact.

Limitations: You can use Vite, but you will need to start the project in vanilla JavaScript.

## How to Solve It

First, you need to create a project using vite.js, to complete this step, you will need to open a new terminal. Then, write the next command:

```

npm create@latest

```
Select the following options:
- Framework: React
- Variant: Vanilla Javascript

After the project is generated, navigate into the project folder and run the following commands:

```
cd projectFolder/
npm install
```

These commands will take you into the project folder and install the basic dependencies. Keep in mind that since we created a vanilla project, React isn't yet installed. To continue, you need to install both react and react-dom by running the following command:

```
npm install react react-dom
```
