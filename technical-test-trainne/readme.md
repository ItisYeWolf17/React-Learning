# Technical Test for Trainee People on React

For this test, you will have two APIs:

    - Facts Random: https://catfact.ninja/fact
    - Random Image: https://cataas.com/cat/says/hello

What do you need to do?

You will need to fetch a random fact about cats and display an image of a cat with the first word of the fact.

```

npm create@latest

```
